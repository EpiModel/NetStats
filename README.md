**Abstract**

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), transmitted across sexual partnership networks, present significant public health challenges globally. Identifying drivers of HIV/STI transmission and opportunities for prevention depends on inferring relevant network from measurable network data. Egocentric network sampling draws egos from the target population and then queries them on the number, attributes, and timing of their partnerships. Data-driven network models depend on accurate and updated egocentric network data as inputs, but to date there have been no network data sources for MSM (in the United States or elsewhere) that broadly span across demographics and geography. In this paper, we present descriptive results from the ARTnet study, the first egocentric network study of MSM from across the United States. ARTnet data collection occurred from 2017 to 2019, with a final sample of 4904 participants who reported on 16198 sexual partnerships. Our analytic aims were to characterize the distribution and heterogeneity in network degree, assortative mixing, and partnership duration. Participants had an average of 1.19 ongoing partnerships (degree), with mean degree for casual partnerships (0.74) higher than mean degree for main partnerships (0.45). The mean rate of one-time partnership acquisition was 0.163 per week (8.5 partners per year). Main partnerships lasted 272.5 weeks on average, while casual partnerships lasted 133.0 weeks. For assortative mixing by race/ethnicity, 45.3% of black, 34.5% of Hispanic, 16.3% of other, and 60.9% of white MSM had partners within their own group. The mean absolute age difference was 9.5 years, with main partners differing by 6.3 years compared to 10.8 years for casual partners. Our analysis suggests that MSM may be at sustained risk for HIV/STI acquisition and transmission through high network degree of sexual partnerships. Overall, these network descriptive statistics provide a foundation for understanding the latest trends in HIV/STI epidemiology among U.S. MSM. The ARTnet dataset will be useful for future statistical and mathematical modeling to understand the population-level implications these network configurations.
